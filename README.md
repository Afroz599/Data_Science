# Titanic Survival Analysis

This project explores the *Titanic dataset* and analyzes factors that influenced passenger survival. 
It demonstrates *data exploration, visualization, and basic predictive insights* using Python.

## 📝 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)  
- Features include passenger demographics, ticket info, class, and survival status.

## 🔍 Analysis Highlights
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand trends and distributions.  
- Visualizations of survival rates by age, gender, class, and other factors.  
- Insights on which features had the most impact on survival.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x  
- pandas, numpy  
- matplotlib, seaborn  

## 📊 Sample Insights
- *Gender:* Females had a higher survival rate than males.  
- *Passenger Class:* Higher class passengers were more likely to survive.  
- *Age:* Children had slightly higher survival chances.  

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/afroz599/titanic-survival-analysis.git

2. Navigate to the folder:

cd titanic-survival-analysis


3. Run the analysis script:

python titanic_analysis.py



📌 Future Work

Add predictive modeling (Logistic Regression, Random Forest).

Improve visualizations and interactivity with Plotly or Dash.
